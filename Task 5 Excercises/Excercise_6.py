#6. Write a program to compute the yearly increase for three employeesâ€™ salary as follow:
#           If the number of working years is more than 10, then the increase is 10 plus the current salary.
#           if the number of working years is 10 then the increase is 7 plus the current salary.
#           Else, the increase is 3 plus the current salary.
# The salary and number of current working years should be entered by the user.
